- structural editing "lispy"

  - doesn't work on spacemacs

DAILP Ingest is a tool that reads Cherokee data from a set of spreadsheets and
makes HTTP calls to upload those data to an Online Linguistic Database (OLD)
instance.

Questions
================================================================================

DF1975--Master
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Should all of the verb roots have category "V"? Or should transitivity
   information be used to determine a transitivity-based category, e.g., "VT",
   "VTA", etc.?

2. What should the Sources be for DF 1975 and DF 2003? The best thing would be
   for me to create a Google Sheet for DAILP sources and automate the ingest of
   it. The ingest script will then have to be modified to document the correct
   source for each form ingested.

   - See my draft sources GSheet at:
     https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W46XymhtohAizs_KVRCNvfTUL0k4-LWwYbEv8aHau_4/edit?usp=sharing

3. Do the "surface form" values of the DF1975--Master spreadsheet need to be
   modified in any way?

4. What syntactic category do we want the inflected verb forms to have? I have
   been giving them "S". We could give them "VP" or some such thing ...

5. DF1975-Master

   a. Row 1881 has a root line that only has values for "Transitivity" "I" and
      "UDB Class" "4a.i.irr.". What does this mean?

   b. Most of the root morpheme columns are missing values for row 362 "send".
      WARNING: current logic may cause the inflected forms to use the root value
      of the preceding row. That is, the form with translation "I'm sending it"
      might be incorrectly using the "set.down.CMP" root shape. CHECK THIS!

   c. There appear to be 4 rows with only a "Transitivity" value, 3 with "I", and
      one with "T".

   d. There are about 100 forms lacking translations. To find them, search for
      translations with the following transcription value: "FIXME TRANSLATION
      NEEDED".

   e. There are a handful of forms lacking valid morpheme gloss values. In some
      (9) cases a default value of "FIXME.MORPHEME.GLOSS.NEEDED" was used.
      Search for this value to find them. In a handful of cases, a value was
      constructed using the first translation value. Here are those constructed
      values:

      - "scatter.(intransitive)"
      - "pour.into.a.container,.fill.up"
      - "(sun.or.moon).shine,.be.sunny"
      - "(the.ground).become.frosty"
      - "thunder"
