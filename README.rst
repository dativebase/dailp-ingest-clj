DAILP Ingest is a tool that reads Cherokee data from a set of spreadsheets and
makes HTTP calls to upload those data to an Online Linguistic Database (OLD)
instance.

Questions
================================================================================

DF1975--Master
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Should all of the verb roots have category "V"? Or should transitivity
   information be used to determine a transitivity-based category, e.g., "VT",
   "VTA", etc.?

2. What should the Sources be for DF 1975 and DF 2003? The best thing would be
   for me to create a Google Sheet for DAILP sources and automate the ingest of
   it. The ingest script will then have to be modified to document the correct
   source for each form ingested.

   - See my draft sources GSheet at:
     https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W46XymhtohAizs_KVRCNvfTUL0k4-LWwYbEv8aHau_4/edit?usp=sharing

3. Do the "surface form" values of the DF1975--Master spreadsheet need to be
   modified in any way?

4. What syntactic category do we want the inflected verb forms to have? I have
   been giving them "S". We could give them "VP" or some such thing ...
